# ABSTRACT:
To control the speed of servo motor the raise time and fall time of the pulse must be controlled. To do that we need to give pulse from the timer circuit which we give from the ATmega microcontroller. The ON time and OFF time duty can be varied by means of PWM technique.
A servo motor is a rotary or linear actuator that is specifically designed to allow precise control of angular or linear postition. Servo motors are typically used to move a part of a machine to an exact postition, and then actively hold it there.
